# Means and evidences of the Uyghur genocide

A proposed joint community project (currently in its [pilot](Pilot) state) to create a briefing on the Uyghur genocide and its supporting evidences.

| Name     | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Problem  | A recurring (and from my point of view: a low-quality) argument of genocide-deniers is that Uyghur genocide is just a Western (CIA/NED run) propaganda. This won't convince anyone, but can be used for bullying and to uncertain new comers. |
| Solution | Create a briefing which presents 1. the means of the genocide, ccp applies (inhuman laws, internment camps, etc) 2. the evidences (official regulations, satellite images, testimonies, etc.) and 3. the relation between the two. |
| Result   | An infographic and a brief report with sources.              |
